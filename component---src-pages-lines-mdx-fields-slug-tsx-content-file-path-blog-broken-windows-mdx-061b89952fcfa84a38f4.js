Specifically, the team was shedding about twenty story points per sprint from our velocity and the reason was simple. Bad code made it into production due to a rushed code review, which led to prioritizing bug fixes, which led to less time being dedicated to new feature development. When this sort of situation unravels on a development team, while being paired with the usual amount of time- to-market demand, the project spins out of control until it's full of broken windows and velocity is at an all-time low.
