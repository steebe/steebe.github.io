I have been diving deeper into photography again for the first time since living in San Diego in 2022. In part,
due to the increased nerdiness of understanding and appreciating gear more, and in part due to being back in
my hometown of Rochester, NY. Perhaps it was inevitable that I would lean further into this hobby, being back
in one of the forerunning cities of optics and film technologies.
